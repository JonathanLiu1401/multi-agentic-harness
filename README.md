# Multi-Agentic Harness

> Internal id / repo / MCP-tool prefix / install dir remain **`claude-manages-codex`** for tool-name,
> permission-allowlist, and install compatibility. The skill/project is **branded "Multi-Agentic Harness"**
> (renamed 2026-07-15) to reflect that it now drives several worker backends, not just Codex. A full
> id-level rename (MCP tool names, install directory, GitHub repo) is a separate breaking change.

A small Python MCP server (`visible_agent_bridge.py`) that powers a **multi-agent worker harness**: Claude
Code's active manager model acts as captain / executive architect / QA tech lead / reviewer while a
**worker backend** does the implementation work — windowless by default (native grok subagents and detached
headless `claude -p` workers), or in visible PowerShell windows for the legacy CLI backends — with logs
persisted under `.claude-codex/runs/<run-id>/` and structured captain steering, completion watchers, and
captain-help mailboxes.

**Live running code vs. this repo:** the authoritative running bridge is `C:/Users/jonny/.agent-bridge/visible_agent_bridge.py` + `claude_worker_runner.py` (NOT a git-tracked directory). This git repo is the source/reference; changes here must be synced into `~/.agent-bridge/` to take effect. The installed skill lives at the double-nested `~/.claude/skills/claude-manages-codex/skills/claude-manages-codex/SKILL.md`.

**Worker backends (2026-07-15, windowless paths added 2026-07-18):** the preferred worker MODEL is
**grok-4.5** (owner is on SuperGrok Heavy); the preferred SPAWN PATHS are the **native grok subagent**
(Agent tool, `subagent_type: "grok"`, proxy-backed sessions — see `plugin/agents/grok.md`) and
**`start_claude_worker`** (detached headless `claude -p` through the local **CLIProxyAPI** gateway on
127.0.0.1:8317; the `model` arg honors any proxy model). **Claude Sonnet** subagents are the fallback;
the **grok CLI** visible-window backend remains for its exclusive extras (Parallel Competition Mode,
Mandatory Parallel Work-Checker); **Google Antigravity (agy)** has a preferred **native subagent path**
with 2 **Gemini** models — Gemini 3.1 Pro
(High), Gemini 3.5 Flash (High) — spawnable as `subagent_type: "agy-gemini-3-1-pro"` / `"agy-gemini-3-5-flash"` through CLIProxyAPI on the agy
account's **separate quota** (not the real Claude/Anthropic subscription; definitions in
`plugin/agents/agy-*.md`), preferred over the legacy visible-terminal `start_visible_agy_worker`;
**Codex is disabled until further notice** (its ChatGPT login is revoked — the code is left intact but
not used). Always `check_worker_backends` before delegating. Much of the older prose below is
Codex-centric because Codex was the original backend — read "Codex" as "the worker backend."

## Tools exposed

> ⚠️ **Codex is DISABLED (owner 2026-07-15, ChatGPT login revoked).** The Codex worker tools below remain documented for a possible future revival only — do not route to Codex. Preferred worker today is grok-4.5 (windowless native subagent or `start_claude_worker`).

- `start_visible_codex_worker` - launch the default single-worker `codex exec --json` path from a final prompt in a visible window with saved structured logs.
- `start_visible_haiku_composed_codex_worker` - let Claude pass a compact captain brief, have Claude Haiku expand the full Codex prompt, then launch the default non-interactive visible CLI worker.
- `start_visible_first_mate_codex_pool` - launch the default non-interactive visible CLI root coordinator for fan-out with structured logs.
- `start_interactive_codex_tui` (**deprecated**) - launch the real interactive Codex TUI only for an explicit user request for a hands-on terminal, while the bridge records sidecar metadata.
- `start_interactive_first_mate_codex_tui` (**deprecated**) - launch the first-mate Codex coordinator in the real interactive Codex TUI only for an explicit hands-on user request.
- `steer_visible_codex_run` - directly interrupt and steer an active visible Codex run on the same thread by default, or launch a visible resume run if the window already closed.
- `request_captain_help` - let a stuck visible Codex worker ask the same Claude captain for feedback through the run mailbox.
- `list_captain_help_requests` / `respond_to_captain_help_request` - let Claude inspect and answer worker help requests, or escalate to the user before steering the same run.
- `submit_captain_report` / `list_captain_reports` - let interactive TUI workers hand a final report back to Claude through a sidecar artifact instead of terminal-only text.
- `start_visible_claude_advisor` - launch a visible Claude Code advisor run.
- `get_visible_run_status` / `list_visible_runs` - read status and recent log lines from a run directory.

## Current bridge behavior

- Codex workers run `gpt-5.6-sol` with `service_tier=fast`. Reasoning effort is selected by Claude per task across `high` / `xhigh` / `max` / `ultra` (defaulting to the `xhigh` floor), rather than pinned to a single tier. At `ultra` effort, `gpt-5.6-sol` natively decomposes work into cooperative subagents within the captain's scope (token-heavy and preview-gated; intentionally unbudgeted — no token or spend cap).
- Claude advisor calls use a central model policy: `fable` / `high` through July 7, 2026, then `opus` / `high`. Override with `CLAUDE_MANAGES_CODEX_ADVISOR_MODEL`.
- The Claude manager model should not write implementation code by default; it writes architecture, constraints, acceptance criteria, steering notes, and review findings.
- Long Codex delegation prompts should be written by the Haiku prompt composer, not by the manager model.
- Claude-managed visible Codex work defaults to `start_visible_first_mate_codex_pool` for fan-out, `start_visible_haiku_composed_codex_worker` for compact single-worker briefs, and `start_visible_codex_worker` when the final prompt already exists.
- The default non-interactive visible CLI path supports structured JSONL logs, direct interrupt steering with `steer_visible_codex_run`, completion watchers, and captain-help mailboxes.
- Visible Codex workers run with full process/tool access so Python-backed skills, `read-past-sessions`, SSH, test runners, and external CLIs work. The requested `sandbox` is treated as permission intent: `read-only` means no edits, not a crippled process sandbox.
- Codex and Claude visible runs record resumable ids (`thread_id` for Codex, `session_id` for Claude).
- Claude steers non-interactive visible Codex runs directly with `steer_visible_codex_run` by default: an in-flight turn is interrupted and the same thread resumes immediately, while an idle JSON-worker window consumes the queue without interruption and closes after a short idle window if no steering arrives.
- If Claude interrupts an active JSON worker, the bridge sends Ctrl+C first and resumes the same Codex thread when its session file is readable; if Codex left an empty interrupted thread, the bridge launches a fresh follow-up with the saved run context and steering instruction.
- Stuck visible Codex workers can call back to the same Claude captain with `request_captain_help`; Claude answers with `respond_to_captain_help_request` or asks the user first when owner judgment is required.
- Visible Codex workers set `NODE_PATH` and `PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH` so Playwright MCP and Node-based Playwright tests can run from delegated Codex sessions.
- Deprecated interactive TUI runs use top-level `codex` rather than `codex exec --json`; when explicitly requested they are user-steered, default to `on-request` approvals, submit final handoff through `captain_reports/final.*`, and auto-close a few seconds after the report by sending Ctrl+C to the run's console with a scoped process-tree fallback.

## Worker backends (added 2026-07-14, windowless paths added 2026-07-18)

Codex is the historically most-documented backend in this README, but the bridge now supports these worker
backends behind the same run-dir mechanics: **native grok subagents** (Agent tool, `subagent_type: "grok"`,
proxy-backed sessions; definition in `plugin/agents/grok.md`), **claude_worker** (`start_claude_worker` /
`steer_claude_run` — detached headless `claude -p` via the local CLIProxyAPI gateway, any proxy model,
implemented by `claude_worker_runner.py`), **Grok CLI** (`grok-4.5`, legacy visible-window, kept for
Parallel Competition Mode + the Mandatory Parallel Work-Checker gate), **Claude Sonnet** (in-process
`Agent` tool, always available), **Codex** (`gpt-5.6-sol`, disabled), and **Antigravity/agy** (preferred
native Gemini subagents: `agy-gemini-3-1-pro` / `agy-gemini-3-5-flash` via
CLIProxyAPI on the agy account's separate quota — see `plugin/agents/agy-*.md`; legacy visible-terminal
`start_visible_agy_worker` still available).
**Grok-4.5 is the preferred worker model; the windowless paths are the preferred spawn paths** (owner
upgraded to SuperGrok Heavy on 2026-07-15); **Claude Sonnet is the fallback** when grok is unavailable
or capped.

**Memory capture (claude-mem):** headless `claude_worker` runs execute under `~/.claude-clx` where claude-mem hooks are enabled, so their work is passively captured. The legacy grok-CLI and agy visible-window backends fire no hooks (no claude-mem). Native grok/agy subagents are covered only by the parent session's capture.

Context windows for grok workers (verified 2026-07-19 on Claude Code 2.1.21x): Claude Code budgets
unknown model IDs at 200k. Deployments should set `CLAUDE_CODE_MAX_CONTEXT_TOKENS=500000` (full
required env block + rationale: `docs/setup/env-vars.md`) in the
settings.json `env` block of proxy-backed worlds — it applies only to non-`claude-` model IDs and gives
grok subagents/workers grok-4.5's real ~500k window with normal autocompaction (undocumented internal —
re-verify after CLI version bumps). Do NOT use a `[1m]` suffix in **grok** agent frontmatter (grok's real window is ~500k; `[1m]` would overshoot it and is stripped in subagent resolution). For Claude main-model launch profiles, `[1m]` IS correct — the canonical Claude model IDs in the launch configs (clx, cld) carry the `[1m]` suffix to request the 1M context window, and `autoCompactWindow` is set to `1000000`. `launchers/clg.cmd` starts a grok **main-model** session
the same way. Related session-wide requirements: `ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=true` (grok rejects >350 tool
definitions per request; deferred loading sends ~14), and Remote Control is mutually exclusive with any
`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` gateway (use `launchers/cld.cmd` for a direct-Anthropic RC-capable world).

Codex is currently **DISABLED** (ChatGPT login revoked) — do not route to it. Use **Antigravity (agy)** as a fallback when grok-4.5 is exhausted/capped, or when explicitly requested — it is a documented fallback path, not last-resort-only. Always call `check_worker_backends` first to confirm a backend is usable.

### Grok backend

New tools, mirroring their Codex counterparts: `start_visible_grok_worker`,
`start_visible_haiku_composed_grok_worker`, `start_visible_first_mate_grok_pool`,
`steer_visible_grok_run`. Grok workers share the same backend-agnostic
`get_visible_run_status` / `list_visible_runs` / `submit_captain_report` / `list_captain_reports` /
`request_captain_help` / `list_captain_help_requests` / `respond_to_captain_help_request` tools Codex
uses.

- Invocation: `grok --prompt-file <prompt.md> --output-format streaming-json --cwd <cwd>
  --permission-mode bypassPermissions -m grok-4.5 [--reasoning-effort low|medium|high] [-r <sessionId>]`.
  (`-p`/`--single` and `--prompt-file` are alternative ways to supply the prompt; combining them errors
  live with `a value is required for '--single <PROMPT>'`, so the runner uses `--prompt-file` alone.)
- Effort caveat: the CLI only accepts `low`/`medium`/`high` on `--reasoning-effort`; `xhigh`/`max` are
  rejected. Grok's own config defaults to `xhigh`, which only applies when the flag is **omitted** — so
  the bridge omits it by default to reach the owner's preferred xhigh tier.
- Callback model: every Grok runner turn auto-writes `captain_reports/final.json` + `final.md` from the
  worker's answer text (Layer 1, robust, always on) regardless of whether a live MCP callback succeeds.
  A `~/.grok/config.toml` `[mcp_servers.agent-visibility]` entry (backed up, merged additively) lets a
  Grok worker also call `submit_captain_report` / `request_captain_help` live (Layer 2). The shared
  allowlist in those two tools was widened from `metadata.agent in (None, "codex")` to
  `(None, "codex", "grok", "agy")`, so Grok workers now report back live; Codex behavior
  is unchanged, and the codex-only steer gate stays codex-specific. See
  `plugin/skills/claude-manages-codex/SKILL.md`, "Worker Backends & Routing" and "Grok Worker Backend",
  for the full doctrine and the config snippet.

### Antigravity (agy) backend

**Preferred path (native Gemini subagents, 2026-07-19):** 2 models — Gemini 3.1 Pro (High), Gemini 3.5 Flash (High) — spawnable as native Claude Code subagents (`subagent_type: "agy-gemini-3-1-pro"` / `"agy-gemini-3-5-flash"`, definitions in `plugin/agents/agy-*.md`) through CLIProxyAPI on the agy
account's **separate quota** (not the real Claude/Anthropic subscription). The agy Gemini subagents draw the {gemini-3.1-pro, gemini-3.5-flash} quota bucket (ample). The other bucket {Claude opus-4-6, sonnet-4-6, gpt-oss-120B} has very low limits — its 5-hour window exhausts fast (observed at 0% while the Gemini bucket had ~96% free) — so the Claude 4.6 models (and GPT-OSS) are served but left UNWIRED as subagents. Large-context agy calls occasionally return a malformed HTTP 200 through the proxy — treat empty/malformed bodies as a retry/fallback signal, not success. Preferred over the legacy
visible-terminal tools below. Requires Antigravity channel auth (`cli-proxy-api.exe -antigravity-login`)
and the `oauth-model-alias.antigravity` block in `config.yaml` — see `docs/setup/agy-antigravity.md`.

Legacy visible-terminal tools, mirroring their Codex/Grok counterparts: `start_visible_agy_worker`,
`start_visible_haiku_composed_agy_worker`, `steer_visible_agy_run` (no first-mate pool tool for this
backend). agy workers share the same backend-agnostic `get_visible_run_status` / `list_visible_runs` /
`submit_captain_report` / `list_captain_reports` / `request_captain_help` / `list_captain_help_requests` /
`respond_to_captain_help_request` tools Codex/Grok use, though nothing in the agy worker's own prompt
tells it to call them (see callback model below).

- Invocation: `agy -p "<prompt>" --model "<model>" --dangerously-skip-permissions --add-dir <cwd>`, run
  with the process `cwd` set to the target directory. agy has no `--prompt-file`, so the full prompt is
  passed inline as a single `-p` argument via PowerShell array splatting (not a `cmd.exe` command line, so
  no 8191-char shim limit — prefer the Haiku composer for very large briefs anyway).
- **Plain text, not streaming JSON**: `agy` has no `--output-format`/`--json` flag at all. The runner runs
  one blocking `agy` call per turn, redirects stdout and stderr to separate files (never merged), appends
  the turn's full unfiltered stdout to `output.txt` + `display.log`, and writes
  `captain_reports/final.md`/`final.json` from that raw stdout. stderr goes to `display.log` only, never
  into `output.txt` or the captain report.
- **Effort is baked into `--model`**, not a flag: `AGY_MODELS_BY_EFFORT = {"high": "Gemini 3.5 Flash
  (High)", "medium": "Gemini 3.5 Flash (Medium)", "low": "Gemini 3.5 Flash (Low)"}`,
  `AGY_DEFAULT_MODEL = "Gemini 3.5 Flash (High)"`. `start_visible_agy_worker`'s `reasoning_effort`
  parameter (default `"high"`) selects the model via `_agy_model_for_effort`; anything unrecognized falls
  back to the default "high" model.
- **No session id, `--continue` is cwd-scoped, not thread-scoped**: agy never prints a session id on a
  plain-text turn. `--conversation <id>` exists in `agy --help` but is unusable without a way to learn
  `<id>`, so all resume/steer in this backend uses `--continue` (resumes the MOST RECENT conversation for
  the working directory, best-effort, not a specific tracked thread). Verified live: a `steer_visible_agy_run`
  call on a fully closed run correctly recalled context from the original run's first turn after launching a
  `--continue` follow-up, confirming real continuity subject to the cwd-scoped caveat.
- Callback model: every agy runner turn auto-writes `captain_reports/final.json` + `final.md` from the
  worker's raw stdout (Layer 1, robust, always on). **No Layer 2 live MCP callback is wired for agy**: `agy
  --help` has no `mcp` subcommand, and the only MCP-shaped file found, `~/.gemini/config/mcp_config.json`,
  is 0 bytes with no documented schema — editing it blindly was judged too risky to the owner's real
  authenticated agy config, so it was left unwired and Layer 1 is the only result path for this backend.
  The shared `submit_captain_report`/`request_captain_help` allowlist does accept `metadata.agent == "agy"`
  (forward-compatible), but the agy worker prompt does not instruct the model to call them. See
  `plugin/skills/claude-manages-codex/SKILL.md`, "Worker Backends & Routing" and "Antigravity / Gemini
  (agy) Worker Backend", for the full doctrine.

## Firstmate skill

This repo bundles a Codex-facing Firstmate skill at [`codex-skills/firstmate/SKILL.md`](codex-skills/firstmate/SKILL.md).
It adapts the FirstMate pattern so **Claude Code is the captain**, **Codex is the first mate**, and the first mate
coordinates an ensemble of Codex agents for scouting, implementation, verification, and review.

Install/sync it locally to:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.codex\skills\firstmate" | Out-Null
Copy-Item .\codex-skills\firstmate\SKILL.md "$HOME\.codex\skills\firstmate\SKILL.md" -Force
```

The visible first-mate runner also embeds the same role contract, so the hierarchy still works before Codex
refreshes its skill index.

## Codex agent profiles

Custom Codex agents live under [`codex-agents/`](codex-agents/):

- `claude-explorer` - no-edit codebase scouting with Python/tool access.
- `claude-implementer` - scoped implementation after Claude grants write permission.
- `claude-reviewer` - no-edit diff and regression review.
- `claude-debugger` - full-tool SSH, device, network, serial, and command-heavy debugging when Claude explicitly allows it.

Install/sync them locally to:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.codex\agents" | Out-Null
Copy-Item .\codex-agents\claude-*.toml "$HOME\.codex\agents\" -Force
```

## Bundled plugin

The Claude Code plugin that drives this bridge lives under [`plugin/`](plugin/):

- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - plugin manifest.
- `plugin/.mcp.json` - registers the `codex-worker` (Codex MCP) and `agent-visibility` (this script) servers.
- `plugin/skills/claude-manages-codex/SKILL.md` - the `claude-manages-codex` skill: Claude as executive captain/architect/reviewer, delegating to a worker backend (windowless grok-4.5 by default, Codex historically). Includes the routing mandate that sends parallel-agent fan-out and implementation work off the manager model to preserve Claude tokens.
- `plugin/skills/claude-manages-codex/references/legacy-backends.md` - per-backend mechanics for the legacy/on-request worker backends (grok CLI, Antigravity/agy, disabled Codex).

The Codex-side advisor plugin lives under [`codex-plugin/`](codex-plugin/):

- `codex-plugin/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` - Codex plugin manifest.
- `codex-plugin/.mcp.json` - registers the visible Claude advisor bridge for Codex.
- `codex-plugin/skills/codex-consults-claude/SKILL.md` - broader Codex-to-Claude bridge contract.
- `codex-plugin/skills/claude-advisor/SKILL.md` - lightweight advisor flow for plan checks, stuck/confused states, and review.

Install or refresh it locally through your personal Codex plugin marketplace, then start a new Codex session:

```powershell
codex plugin add codex-consults-claude@personal
```

## Official OpenAI Codex plugin companion

This bridge is designed to cooperate with OpenAI's official Claude Code plugin:
[`openai/codex-plugin-cc`](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc).

Use the official plugin for stable `/codex:*` workflows:

- `/codex:setup`
- `/codex:review`
- `/codex:adversarial-review`
- `/codex:rescue`
- `/codex:transfer`
- `/codex:status`
- `/codex:result`
- `/codex:cancel`

Install it in Claude Code with:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc
/plugin install codex@openai-codex
/reload-plugins
/codex:setup
```

Use this bridge's `start_visible_first_mate_codex_pool` for the observable, captain-steered
Claude-as-captain / Codex-as-first-mate hierarchy over multiple Codex agents. Use a deprecated interactive first-mate TUI only when the user explicitly requests hands-on terminal control. Use the official `/codex:rescue` command for single
delegated rescue tasks and `/codex:review` or `/codex:adversarial-review` for standard read-only review.

## Fixes in this snapshot

This copy includes fixes over the original bridge, found while testing against Codex CLI **v0.142.2**:

1. **Removed-flag crash.** The launcher passed `codex exec ... --ask-for-approval <policy>`, a flag that
   newer Codex CLIs no longer accept. Replaced it with the config-override form
   `-c approval_policy="<policy>"`, which is accepted and equivalent.

2. **UTF-8 BOM read crash.** PowerShell's `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` writes `status.json` with a BOM
   in Windows PowerShell 5.1. The status readers now use `encoding="utf-8-sig"` for `status.json` and
   `metadata.json`, which tolerates a BOM or its absence.

3. **UTF-8 mojibake / UTF-16 log corruption.** The detached PowerShell inherited the system OEM code page,
   and `Tee-Object` wrote `display.log` as UTF-16LE. Both runners now force UTF-8 console encoding before
   launching the child and tee through a `Write-Raw` helper (`Add-Content -Encoding UTF8`).

4. **Leaked agent runtimes.** Codex left orphaned `codex.exe`, `node.exe`, and `codex-windows-sandbox-setup.exe`
   processes alive after each run. Each run script now reaps its own descendant process tree on completion via
   `Stop-RunDescendants`, scoped strictly to descendants of that run's own PowerShell `$PID`. The Python server
   also registers an `atexit` hook that `taskkill /T /F`s every visible-run window it launched at session end.

5. **Read-only sandbox broke Python, skills, and SSH.** Visible Codex workers now get full process/tool access
   while the prompt carries a separate permission contract. A `read-only` request becomes no-edit intent, so
   Codex can still run Python, `read-past-sessions`, SSH, and repo tooling without permission to mutate files.

6. **Expensive manager-model prompt writing.** Non-trivial Codex delegation can now go through
   `start_visible_haiku_composed_codex_worker`: Claude emits a compact captain brief, Haiku/low expands the full
   worker prompt in safe mode, and Codex executes the composed prompt.

7. **Session context and resume.** Visible workers inject a session-context bootstrap and can resume prior Codex
   threads or Claude advisor sessions by id.

8. **Claude could not steer visible Codex mid-session.** Visible Codex runs now create `steer_queue/` and
   `steer_done/` directories. Claude can call `steer_visible_codex_run`; by default it interrupts an in-flight
   turn and resumes the same recorded Codex thread immediately with the captain instruction. Pass
   `interrupt_current_turn=false` to wait for the turn boundary instead. If the window already closed, the tool
   starts a visible `codex resume` run against the same `thread_id`. Steering can
    also carry an updated `sandbox` permission intent when Claude moves a run from scouting to scoped writes.

9. **Visible launcher stayed stuck at `created`.** The launcher used PowerShell `-NoExit`, which could leave a
    visible shell alive while the run directory stayed locked or never advanced cleanly from the caller's view. It
    now launches with `-NoProfile` and lets the script's own short close delay control visibility and cleanup.

10. **Stuck workers had no same-captain callback.** Visible Codex prompts now include a per-run captain-help
    mailbox. A stuck worker calls `request_captain_help` and stops; Claude polls the request, can ask the user if
    the decision requires owner judgment, then `respond_to_captain_help_request` queues steering back to the same
    run/thread for non-interactive workers. Open TUI workers need direct terminal steering or a resumed TUI session
    because queued steering cannot type into an already-open TUI.

11. **Interactive TUI reports were terminal-only.** Real Codex TUI sessions do not emit `codex exec --json`
    events or `--output-last-message`, so a final answer typed into the TUI is not a reliable captain handoff.
    Interactive prompts now require `submit_captain_report`; the bridge writes `captain_reports/final.json` and
    `final.md`, exposes them through `get_visible_run_status`, and closes the TUI after the report unless the
    worker sets `close_tui=false`.

12. **Interactive TUI windows could outlive the finished agent turn.** Closing only the launcher PowerShell
    process could leave the `cmd.exe`/Codex TUI process that owned the visible terminal window. The report
    watcher now sends Ctrl+C to the run's console, waits briefly, then falls back to `taskkill /T /F` for that
    launcher tree only.

13. **Interrupt steering could race Codex's local thread store.** A forced kill could return a thread id whose
    rollout JSONL was still empty, making `codex resume` fail. Interrupt steering now tries Ctrl+C first,
    waits for a readable thread before resuming, and falls back to a fresh context-rich follow-up when the
    interrupted thread is not recoverable.

## Deprecated: Interactive TUI Mode

This mode remains functional for regression compatibility, but it is not the default. Use it only when the user explicitly asks for a hands-on interactive Codex terminal, and say when this deprecated path is being used.

Use `start_interactive_codex_tui` for an explicitly requested hands-on single-worker terminal. Use `start_interactive_first_mate_codex_tui` only when that explicit request also needs a first mate coordinating Codex subagents.

This mode opens the real Codex TUI in a visible terminal. The user can approve, reject, and steer inside that terminal. The bridge still creates `.claude-codex/runs/<run-id>/` with `prompt.md`, `session_context.md`, `metadata.json`, `status.json`, `notes.md`, and best-effort `session_id.txt`.

Interactive TUI prompts include a captain handoff contract. Codex must call `submit_captain_report` before stopping, which writes `captain_reports/final.json` and `final.md`; Claude reads those through `get_visible_run_status` or `list_captain_reports`. By default the launcher watches for that report, waits about five seconds, sends Ctrl+C to the TUI console, and uses a scoped process-tree fallback if the window does not exit. Pass `auto_close_after_report=false` or `close_tui=false` when the terminal should stay open.

This mode is intentionally lower-fidelity than `codex exec --json`: it can flash-close, `display.log` contains launcher/status lines rather than a full transcript, queued steering is not injected into an already-open TUI, and captain handoff depends on the worker remembering `submit_captain_report`. Use `start_visible_haiku_composed_codex_worker` or `start_visible_codex_worker` for the default single-worker path and `start_visible_first_mate_codex_pool` for fan-out.

## E2E verification

Run the full bridge E2E from the repo root:

```powershell
python .\tests\e2e_visible_bridge.py
```

The suite launches real visible runs for queued steering, closed-run resume steering, interrupt steering,
Haiku-composed Codex, first-mate Codex, and the budget-capped Claude advisor path.

## Usage

Wire it into an MCP client, such as Claude Code, by pointing at the script:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-visibility": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/visible_agent_bridge.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Requires the `codex` CLI on `PATH` for the legacy Codex tools, `claude` for the advisor tool, and a
reachable CLIProxyAPI gateway (see "CLIProxyAPI setup" above) for `start_claude_worker` and native grok
subagents.

> Note: the MCP server loads the script at startup, so after editing it you must reload/restart the MCP
> client for changes to take effect.

If you use Claude Code's permission allowlist, include the windowless worker tools
(`start_claude_worker`, `steer_claude_run`, `check_worker_backends`) alongside the Haiku-composed worker
tool and the older visible-agent tools:

```json
{
