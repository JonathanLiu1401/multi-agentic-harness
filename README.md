# claude-manages-codex-bridge

A small Python MCP server (`visible_agent_bridge.py`) that powers the **visible-agent harness** for the
`claude-manages-codex` workflow: Claude Code acts as captain/manager/architect/reviewer while OpenAI Codex
does the implementation work. The bridge launches Codex and Claude advisor sessions in visible PowerShell
windows so you can watch prompts, streamed events, agent messages, commands, token usage, and diffs live,
while also persisting logs under `.claude-codex/runs/<run-id>/`.

## Tools exposed

- `start_visible_codex_worker` - launch `codex exec --json` in a visible window with saved logs.
- `start_visible_first_mate_codex_pool` - launch a visible Codex root coordinator that spawns/manages subagents.
- `start_visible_claude_advisor` - launch a visible Claude Code advisor run.
- `get_visible_run_status` / `list_visible_runs` - read status and recent log lines from a run directory.

## Firstmate skill

This repo bundles a Codex-facing Firstmate skill at [`codex-skills/firstmate/SKILL.md`](codex-skills/firstmate/SKILL.md).
It adapts the FirstMate pattern so **Claude Code is the captain**, **Codex is the first mate**, and the first mate
coordinates an ensemble of Codex agents for scouting, implementation, verification, and review.

Install/sync it locally to:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Force "$HOME\.codex\skills\firstmate" | Out-Null
Copy-Item .\codex-skills\firstmate\SKILL.md "$HOME\.codex\skills\firstmate\SKILL.md" -Force
```

The visible first-mate runner also embeds the same role contract, so the hierarchy still works before Codex
refreshes its skill index.

## Bundled plugin

The Claude Code plugin that drives this bridge lives under [`plugin/`](plugin/):

- `plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` - plugin manifest.
- `plugin/.mcp.json` - registers the `codex-worker` (Codex MCP) and `agent-visibility` (this script) servers.
- `plugin/skills/claude-manages-codex/SKILL.md` - the `claude-manages-codex` skill: Claude as captain/manager/reviewer, Codex as first mate and worker harness. Includes the routing mandate that sends parallel-agent fan-out and heavy coding work through Codex to preserve Claude tokens.

## Official OpenAI Codex plugin companion

This bridge is designed to cooperate with OpenAI's official Claude Code plugin:
[`openai/codex-plugin-cc`](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc).

Use the official plugin for stable `/codex:*` workflows:

- `/codex:setup`
- `/codex:review`
- `/codex:adversarial-review`
- `/codex:rescue`
- `/codex:transfer`
- `/codex:status`
- `/codex:result`
- `/codex:cancel`

Install it in Claude Code with:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add openai/codex-plugin-cc
/plugin install codex@openai-codex
/reload-plugins
/codex:setup
```

Use this bridge's `start_visible_first_mate_codex_pool` when you want the observable Claude-as-captain /
Codex-as-first-mate hierarchy over multiple Codex agents. Use the official `/codex:rescue` command for single
delegated rescue tasks and `/codex:review` or `/codex:adversarial-review` for standard read-only review.

## Fixes in this snapshot

This copy includes fixes over the original bridge, found while testing against Codex CLI **v0.142.2**:

1. **Removed-flag crash.** The launcher passed `codex exec ... --ask-for-approval <policy>`, a flag that
   newer Codex CLIs no longer accept. Replaced it with the config-override form
   `-c approval_policy="<policy>"`, which is accepted and equivalent.

2. **UTF-8 BOM read crash.** PowerShell's `Set-Content -Encoding UTF8` writes `status.json` with a BOM
   in Windows PowerShell 5.1. The status readers now use `encoding="utf-8-sig"` for `status.json` and
   `metadata.json`, which tolerates a BOM or its absence.

3. **UTF-8 mojibake / UTF-16 log corruption.** The detached PowerShell inherited the system OEM code page,
   and `Tee-Object` wrote `display.log` as UTF-16LE. Both runners now force UTF-8 console encoding before
   launching the child and tee through a `Write-Raw` helper (`Add-Content -Encoding UTF8`).

4. **Leaked agent runtimes.** Codex left orphaned `codex.exe`, `node.exe`, and `codex-windows-sandbox-setup.exe`
   processes alive after each run. Each run script now reaps its own descendant process tree on completion via
   `Stop-RunDescendants`, scoped strictly to descendants of that run's own PowerShell `$PID`. The Python server
   also registers an `atexit` hook that `taskkill /T /F`s every visible-run window it launched at session end.

## Usage

Wire it into an MCP client, such as Claude Code, by pointing at the script:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "agent-visibility": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["path/to/visible_agent_bridge.py"]
    }
  }
}
```

Requires the `codex` CLI on `PATH` for Codex tools and `claude` for the advisor tool.

> Note: the MCP server loads the script at startup, so after editing it you must reload/restart the MCP
> client for changes to take effect.
